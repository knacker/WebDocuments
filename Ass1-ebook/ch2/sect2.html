    <title>How to Draw the Triangle with SVG</title>
  </head>

  <body><p><pre>A triangle with SVG can be drawn using the polygon element.<polygon points="50,50 60,10 85,45">. The values shown are the tuples
(50,50) (60,10) (85,45) stand for the coordinates, where each point of the triangle is located in the grid. 
Using style="stroke:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-width:2" you can set the desired style you want to use for your triangle. 
In this particular example, the fill of the triangle is black, which is represented by the rgb value (0,0,0).
The line thickness can be set using stroke-width, which is set here to 2.</pre></p>
