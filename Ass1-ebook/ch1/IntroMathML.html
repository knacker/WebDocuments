      <h1>Using MathML</h1>
    </header> First of all, I will tell you what MathML actually is. MathML is
  a document format, that is being used to express mathematical formulas and
  complex expressions. Since 2010, it is recommended by W3C. In the following
  table, I will introduce the elements, that are needed for creating our
  formula, which I will talk about more in depth soon. <header>
      <h1>Elements that are going to be used</h1>
    </header> <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>&lt;element&gt;</th>

          <th>Description<br /></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;mtext&gt;</td>

          <td>This is being used to write text inside the math namespace.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;mrow&gt;</td>

          <td>The Term &lt;mrow&gt; is being used to group expressions
          together .</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;mi&gt;</td>

          <td>This can be used for variable names, such as x or other
          Symbols.<br /></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;mo&gt;</td>

          <td>We can use this to write down Symbols, such as ",".</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;mfrac&gt;</td>

          <td>Using this, will create a fraction, where the first argument
          will be the numerator<br />and the second argument will be the
          denominator.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table> </p></body>
