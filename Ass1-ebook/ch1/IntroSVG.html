		<h1>Creating a SVG</h1>
	</header> Next, we are going to talk about what a SVG is and discuss the
	elements, that are going to be used for our example. So what is a SVG
	actually? A SVG is a Scalable Vector graphic, that is recommended, like
	MathML, by the W3C. SVG's have a few advantages over regular png's, such as
	smaller size aswell as the ability, to scale with the screen size. In the
	following table you can see, what elements of SVG can be used to create a
	coordinate system and a polygon. <header>
		<h1>Elements that are going to be used</h1>
		</header> <table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>&lt;element&gt;</th>
				
				<th>Description<br /></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;polygon&gt;</td>
				
				<td>The polygon element is being used to create an object, that
					contains atleast <br />three sides. It is made of straight lines and
				the shape is closed</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr></tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;line&gt;</td>
				
				<td>This can be used to create a simple line, that connects 2
				points.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>&lt;text&gt;<br /></td>
				
				<td>Using the &lt;text&gt; element, we can write simple text in the
				SVG namespace.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table> </p></body>
